title: Homological Convolutional Neural Networks
abstract: 'Deep learning methods have demonstrated outstanding performances on classification
  and regression tasks on homogeneous data types (e.g., image, audio, and text data).
  However, tabular data still pose a challenge, with classic machine learning approaches
  being often computationally cheaper and equally effective than increasingly complex
  deep learning architectures. The challenge arises from the fact that, in tabular
  data, the correlation among features is weaker than the one from spatial or semantic
  relationships in images or natural language, and the dependency structures need
  to be modeled without any prior information. In this work, we propose a novel deep
  learning architecture that exploits the data structural organization through topologically
  constrained network representations to gain relational information from sparse tabular
  inputs. The resulting model leverages the power of convolution and is centered on
  a limited number of concepts from network topology to guarantee: (i) a data-centric
  and deterministic building pipeline; (ii) a high level of interpretability over
  the inference process; and (iii) an adequate room for scalability. We test our model
  on $18$ benchmark datasets against $5$ classic machine learning and $3$ deep learning
  models, demonstrating that our approach reaches state-of-the-art performances on
  these challenging datasets. The code to reproduce all our experiments is provided
