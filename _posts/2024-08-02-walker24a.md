title: 'Explicit neural surfaces: learning continuous geometry with deformation fields'
abstract: We introduce Explicit Neural Surfaces (ENS), an efficient smooth surface
  representation that directly encodes topology with a deformation field from a known
  base domain. We apply this representation to reconstruct explicit surfaces from
  multiple views, where we use a series of neural deformation fields to progressively
  transform the base domain into a target shape. By using meshes as discrete surface
  proxies, we train the deformation fields through efficient differentiable rasterization.
  Using a fixed base domain allows us to have Laplace-Beltrami eigenfunctions as an
  intrinsic positional encoding alongside standard extrinsic Fourier features, with
  which our approach can capture fine surface details. Compared to implicit surfaces,
  ENS trains faster and has several orders of magnitude faster inference times. The
  explicit nature of our approach also allows higher-quality mesh extraction whilst
  maintaining competitive surface reconstruction performance and real-time capabilities.
