title: Internal representations of vision models through the lens of frames on data
  manifolds
abstract: While the last five years have seen considerable progress in understanding
  the internal representations of deep learning models, many questions remain. This
  is especially true when trying to understand the impact of model design choices,
  such as model architecture or training algorithm, on hidden representation geometry
  and dynamics. In this work we present a new approach to studying such representations
  inspired by the idea of a frame on the tangent bundle of a manifold. Our construction,
  which we call a neural frame, is formed by assembling a set of vectors representing
  specific types of perturbations of a data point, for example infinitesimal augmentations,
  noise perturbations, or perturbations produced by a generative model, and studying
  how these change as they pass through a network. Using neural frames, we make observations
  about the way that models process, layer-by-layer, specific modes of variation within
  a small neighborhood of a datapoint. Our results provide new perspectives on a number
  of phenomena, such as the manner in which training with augmentation produces model
  invariance or the proposed trade-off between adversarial training and model generalization.
