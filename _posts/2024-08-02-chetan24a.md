title: 'Distance Learner: Incorporating Manifold Prior to Model Training'
abstract: The manifold hypothesis (real-world data concentrates near low-dimensional
  manifolds) is suggested as the principle behind the effectiveness of machine learning
  algorithms in very high-dimensional problems that are common in domains such as
  vision and speech. Multiple methods have been proposed to explicitly incorporate
  the manifold hypothesis as a prior in modern Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), with varying
  success. In this paper, we propose a new method, <em>Distance Learner</em>, to incorporate
  this prior for DNN-based classifiers. <em>Distance Learner</em> is trained to predict
  the <em>distance</em> of a point from the underlying manifold of each class, rather
  than the class label. For classification, <em>Distance Learner</em> then chooses
  the class corresponding to the closest predicted class manifold. <em>Distance Learner</em>
  can also identify points as being out of distribution (belonging to neither class),
  if the distance to the closest manifold is higher than a threshold. We evaluate
  our method on multiple synthetic datasets and show that <em>Distance Learner</em>
  learns much more meaningful classification boundaries compared to a standard classifier.
  We also evaluate our method on the task of adversarial robustness and find that
  it not only outperforms standard classifiers by a large margin but also performs
  at par with classifiers trained via well-accepted standard adversarial training.
