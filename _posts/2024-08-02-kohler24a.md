title: Symmetric models for radar response modeling
abstract: Many radar applications require complex radar signature models that incorporate
  characteristics of an objectâ€™s shape and dynamics as well as sensing effects. Even
  though high-fidelity, first-principles radar simulators are available, they tend
  to be resource-intensive and do not easily support the requirements of agile and
  large-scale AI development and evaluation frameworks. Deep learning represents an
  attractive alternative to these numerical methods, but can have large data requirements
  and limited generalization ability. In this work, we present the Radar Equivariant
  Model (REM), the first SO(3)-equivaraint model for predicting radar responses from
  object meshes. By constraining our model to the symmetries inherent to radar sensing,
  REM is able to achieve a high level reconstruction of signals generated by a first-principles
  radar model and shows improved performance and sample efficiency over other encoder-decoder
  models.
