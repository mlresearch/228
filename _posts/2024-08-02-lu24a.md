title: 'AMES: A differentiable embedding space selection framework for latent graph
  inference'
abstract: In real-world scenarios, although data entities may possess inherent relationships,
  the specific graph illustrating their connections might not be directly accessible.
  Latent graph inference addresses this issue by enabling Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
  to operate on point cloud data, dynamically learning the necessary graph structure.
  These graphs are often derived from a latent embedding space, which can be modeled
  using Euclidean, hyperbolic, spherical, or product spaces. However, currently, there
  is no principled differentiable method for determining the optimal embedding space.
  In this work, we introduce the Attentional Multi-Embedding Selection (AMES) framework,
  a differentiable method for selecting the best embedding space for latent graph
  inference through backpropagation, considering a downstream task. Our framework
  consistently achieves comparable or superior results compared to previous methods
  for latent graph inference across five benchmark datasets. Importantly, our approach
  eliminates the need for conducting multiple experiments to identify the optimal
  embedding space. Furthermore, we explore interpretability techniques that track
  the gradient contributions of different latent graphs, shedding light on how our
  attention-based, fully differentiable approach learns to choose the appropriate
  latent space. In line with previous works, our experiments emphasize the advantages
  of hyperbolic spaces in enhancing performance. More importantly, our interpretability
  framework provides a general approach for quantitatively comparing embedding spaces
  across different tasks based on their contributions, a dimension that has been overlooked
  in previous literature on latent graph inference.
