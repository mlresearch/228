title: Geometry of abstract learned knowledge in deep RL agents
abstract: Data from neural recordings suggest that mammalian brains represent physical
  and abstract task-relevant variables through low-dimensional neural manifolds. In
  a recent electrophysiological study (Nieh et al., 2021), mice performed an evidence
  accumulation task while moving along a virtual track. Nonlinear dimensionality reduction
  of the population activity revealed that task-relevant variables were jointly mapped
  in an orderly manner in the low-dimensional space. Here we trained deep reinforcement
  learning (RL) agents on the same evidence accumulation task and found that their
  neural activity can be described with a low-dimensional manifold spanned by task-relevant
  variables. These results provide further insight into similarities and differences
  between neural dynamics in mammals and deep RL agents. Furthermore, we showed that
  manifold learning can be used to characterize the representational space of the
  RL agents with the potential to improve the interpretability of decision-making
  in RL.
