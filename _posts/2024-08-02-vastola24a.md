title: Optimal packing of attractor states in neural representations
abstract: 'Animals’ internal states reflect variables like their position in space,
  orientation, decisions, and motor actions—but how should these internal states be
  arranged? Internal states which frequently transition between one another should
  be close enough that transitions can happen quickly, but not so close that neural
  noise significantly impacts the stability of those states, and how reliably they
  can be encoded and decoded. In this paper, we study the problem of striking a balance
  between these two concerns, which we call an ‘optimal packing’ problem since it
  resembles mathematical problems like sphere packing. While this problem is generally
  extremely difficult, we show that symmetries in environmental transition statistics
  imply certain symmetries of the optimal neural representations, which allows us
  in some cases to exactly solve for the optimal state arrangement. We focus on two
  toy cases: uniform transition statistics, and cyclic transition statistics. Code
