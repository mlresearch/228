title: 'Haldane bundles: a dataset for learning to predict the Chern number of line
  bundles on the torus'
abstract: Characteristic classes, which are abstract topological invariants associated
  with vector bundles, have become an important notion in modern physics with surprising
  real-world consequences. As a representative example, the incredible properties
  of topological insulators, which are insulators in their bulk but conductors on
  their surface, can be completely characterized by a specific characteristic class
  associated with their electronic band structure, the first Chern class. Given their
  importance to next generation computing and the computational challenge of calculating
  them using first-principles approaches, there is a need to develop machine learning
  approaches to predict the characteristic classes associated with a material system.
  To aid in this program we introduce the Haldane bundle dataset, which consists of
  synthetically generated complex line bundles on the $2$-torus. We envision this
  dataset, which is not as challenging as noisy and sparsely measured real-world datasets
  but (as we show) still difficult for off-the-shelf architectures, to be a testing
  ground for architectures that incorporate the rich topological and geometric priors
  underlying characteristic classes.
