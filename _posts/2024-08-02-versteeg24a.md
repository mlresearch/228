title: Expressive dynamics models with nonlinear injective readouts enable reliable
  recovery of latent features from neural activity
abstract: An emerging framework in neuroscience uses the rules that govern how a neural
  circuit’s state evolves over time to understand the circuit’s underlying computation.
  While these <em>neural dynamics</em> cannot be directly measured, new techniques
  attempt to estimate them by modeling observed neural recordings as a low-dimensional
  latent dynamical system embedded into a higher-dimensional neural space. How these
  models represent the readout from latent space to neural space can affect the interpretability
  of the latent representation – for example, for models with a linear readout could
  make simple, low-dimensional dynamics unfolding on a non-linear neural manifold
  appear excessively complex and high-dimensional. Additionally, standard readouts
  (both linear and non-linear) often lack injectivity, meaning that they don’t obligate
  changes in latent state to directly affect activity in the neural space. During
  training, non-injective readouts incentivize the model to invent dynamics that misrepresent
  the underlying system and computation. To address the challenges presented by non-linearity
  and non-injectivity, we combined a custom readout with a previously developed low-dimensional
  latent dynamics model to create the Ordinary Differential equations autoencoder
  with Injective Nonlinear readout (ODIN). We generated a synthetic spiking dataset
  by non-linearly embedding activity from a low-dimensional dynamical system into
  higher-D neural activity. We show that, in contrast to alternative models, ODIN
  is able to recover ground-truth latent activity from these data even when the nature
  of the system and embedding are unknown. Additionally, we show that ODIN enables
  the unsupervised recovery of underlying dynamical features (e.g., fixed points)
  and embedding geometry (e.g., the neural manifold) over alternative models. Overall,
  ODIN’s ability to recover ground-truth latent features with low dimensionality make
  it a promising method for distilling interpretable dynamics that can explain neural
  computation.
