title: Curvature Fields from Shading Fields
abstract: We re-examine the estimation of 3D shape from images that are caused by
  shading of diffuse Lambertian surfaces. We propose a neural model that is motivated
  by the well-documented perceptual effect in which shape is perceived from shading
  without a precise perception of lighting. Our model operates independently in each
  receptive field and produces a scalar statistic of surface curvature for that field.
  The model’s architecture builds on previous mathematical analyses of lighting-invariant
  shape constraints, and it leverages geometric structure to provide equivariance
  under image rotations and translations. Applying our model in parallel across a
  dense set of receptive fields produces a curvature field that we show is quite stable
  under changes to a surface’s albedo pattern (texture) and also to changes in lighting,
  even when lighting varies spatially across the surface.
