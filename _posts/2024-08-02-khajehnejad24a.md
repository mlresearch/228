title: On complex network dynamics of an in vitro neuronal system during Rest and
  Gameplay
abstract: 'In this study, we focus on characterizing the complex network dynamics
  of <em>in vitro</em> neuronal system of live biological cells during two distinct
  activity states: spontaneous rest state and engagement in a real-time (closed-loop)
  game environment. We use <em>DishBrain</em> which is a system that embodies <em>in
  vitro</em> neural networks with <em>in silico</em> computation using a high-density
  multi-electrode array. First, we embed the spiking activity of these channels in
  a lower-dimensional space using various representation learning methods. We then
  extract a subset of representative channels that are consistent across all of the
  neuronal preparations. Next, by analyzing these low-dimensional representations,
  we explore the patterns of macroscopic neuronal network dynamics during the learning
  process. Remarkably, our findings indicate that just using the low-dimensional embedding
  of representative channels is sufficient to differentiate the neuronal culture during
  the Rest and Gameplay conditions. Furthermore, we characterise the evolving neuronal
  <em>connectivity</em> patterns within the <em>DishBrain</em> system over time during
  Gameplay in comparison to the Rest condition. Notably, our investigation shows dynamic
  changes in the overall connectivity within the same region and across multiple regions
  on the multi-electrode array only during Gameplay. These findings underscore the
  plasticity of these neuronal networks in response to external stimuli and highlight
  the potential for modulating connectivity in a controlled environment. The ability
  to distinguish between neuronal states using reduced-dimensional representations
  points to the presence of underlying patterns that could be pivotal for real-time
  monitoring and manipulation of neuronal cultures. Additionally, this provides insight
  into how biological based information processing systems rapidly adapt and learn
  and may lead to new or improved algorithms.'
