title: Random field augmentations for self-supervised representation learning
abstract: Self-supervised representation learning is heavily dependent on data augmentations
  to specify the invariances encoded in representations. Previous work has shown that
  applying diverse data augmentations is crucial to downstream performance, but augmentation
  techniques remain under-explored. In this work, we propose a new family of local
  transformations based on Gaussian random fields to generate image augmentations
  for self-supervised representation learning. These transformations generalize the
  well-established affine and color transformations (translation, rotation, color
  jitter, etc.) and greatly increase the space of augmentations by allowing transformation
  parameter values to vary from pixel to pixel. The parameters are treated as continuous
  functions of spatial coordinates, and modeled as independent Gaussian random fields.
  Empirical results show the effectiveness of the new transformations for self-supervised
  representation learning. Specifically, we achieve a 1.7% top-1 accuracy improvement
  over baseline on ImageNet downstream classification, and a 3.6% improvement on out-of-distribution
  iNaturalist downstream classification. However, due to the flexibility of the new
  transformations, learned representations are sensitive to hyperparameters. While
  mild transformations improve representations, we observe that strong transformations
  can degrade the structure of an image, indicating that balancing the diversity and
  strength of augmentations is important for improving generalization of learned representations.
