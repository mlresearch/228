title: Decorrelating neurons using persistence
abstract: We propose a novel way to regularise deep learning models by reducing high
  correlations between neurons. For this, we present two regularisation terms computed
  from the weights of a minimum spanning tree of the clique whose vertices are the
  neurons of a given network (or a sample of those), where weights on edges are correlation
  dissimilarities. We explore their efficacy by performing a set of proof-of-concept
  experiments, for which our new regularisation terms outperform some popular ones.
  We demonstrate that, in these experiments, naive minimisation of all correlations
  between neurons obtains lower accuracies than our regularisation terms. This suggests
  that redundancies play a significant role in artificial neural networks, as evidenced
  by some studies in neuroscience for real networks. We include a proof of differentiability
  of our regularisers, thus developing the first effective topological persistence-based
  regularisation terms that consider the whole set of neurons and that can be applied
  to a feedforward architecture in any deep learning task such as classification,
  data generation, or regression.
