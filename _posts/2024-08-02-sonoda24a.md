title: Joint Group Invariant Functions on Data-Parameter Domain Induce Universal Neural
  Networks
abstract: The symmetry and geometry of input data are considered to be encoded in
  the internal data representation inside the neural network, but the specific encoding
  rule has been less investigated. In this study, we present a systematic method to
  induce a generalized neural network and its right inverse operator, called the \emph{ridgelet
  transform}, from a \emph{joint group invariant function} on the data-parameter domain.
  Since the ridgelet transform is an inverse, (1) it can describe the arrangement
  of parameters for the network to represent a target function, which is understood
  as the \emph{encoding rule}, and (2) it implies the \emph{universality} of the network.
  Based on the group representation theory, we present a new simple proof of the universality
  by using Schurâ€™s lemma in a unified manner covering a wide class of networks, for
  example, the original ridgelet transform, formal \emph{deep} networks, and the dual
  voice transform. Since traditional universality theorems were demonstrated based
  on functional analysis, this study sheds light on the group theoretic aspect of
  the approximation theory, connecting geometric deep learning to abstract harmonic
  analysis.
