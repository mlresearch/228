title: Structural Similarities Between Language Models and Neural Response Measurements
abstract: Large language models have complicated internal dynamics, but induce representations
  of words and phrases whose geometry we can study. Human language processing is also
  opaque, but neural response measurements can provide (noisy) recordings of activations
  during listening or reading, from which we can extract similar representations of
  words and phrases. Here we study the extent to which the geometries induced by these
  representations, share similarities in the context of brain decoding. We find that
  the larger neural language models get, the more their representations are structurally
  similar to neural response measurements from brain imaging.
