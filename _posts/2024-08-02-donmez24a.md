title: 'Discovering latent causes and memory modification: A computational approach
  using symmetry and geometry'
abstract: We learn from our experiences, even though they are never exactly the same.
  This implies that we need to assess their similarity to apply what we have learned
  from one experience to another. It is proposed that we “cluster” our experiences
  based on (hidden) <em>latent causes</em> that we infer. It is also suggested that
  surprises, which occur when our predictions are incorrect, help us categorize our
  experiences into distinct groups. In this paper, we develop a computational theory
  that emulates these processes based on two basic concepts from intuitive physics
  and Gestalt psychology using symmetry and geometry. We apply our approach to simple
  tasks that involve inductive reasoning. Remarkably, the output of our computational
  approach aligns closely with human responses.
